# Scalping Trading Bot

## Overview
A high-frequency automated scalping bot that exploits market microstructure inefficiencies by analyzing real-time order flow imbalances. The system captures small price movements through sophisticated market depth analysis and lightning-fast execution.

## Core Strategy Logic

### 1. Market Microstructure Analysis
- **Real-time Order Flow**: WebSocket connection for sub-second market data
- **5-Level Market Depth**: Complete order book visibility (L2 data)
- **Institutional Footprints**: Tracks large order accumulation patterns

**Key Data Points:**
- Last Traded Price (LTP) - Current market price
- Total Buy/Sell Quantities - Overall market sentiment  
- Bid/Ask Levels 1-5 - Support/resistance zones
- Order Flow Imbalances - Directional pressure indicators

### 2. Advanced Signal Generation

#### Buy Signal Criteria
```
Buy Pressure: 70-95% of total volume
Order Book Ratio: Top 5 buy levels > 1.5x sell levels
Market Logic: Institutional accumulation with strong support
```

#### Sell Signal Criteria  
```
Sell Pressure: 70-95% of total volume
Order Book Ratio: Top 5 sell levels > 1.5x buy levels
Market Logic: Distribution phase with heavy resistance
```

#### Signal Processing
- **Multi-stock Analysis**: Simultaneous monitoring of entire universe
- **Strength Ranking**: Dominance percentage scoring (0-100%)
- **Best-of-breed Selection**: Only strongest signal gets executed
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Configurable pressure bounds and multipliers

### 3. Risk Management Framework

#### Dynamic Position Sizing
- **Testing Mode**: Fixed 1 share per trade
- **Live Mode**: Percentage-based capital allocation
- **Balance Integration**: Real-time broker balance monitoring

#### Precision Risk Controls
- **Stop Loss**: 0.25% of entry price (tight risk control)
- **Take Profit**: 1.0% of entry price (4:1 reward ratio)
- **Tick-Perfect Pricing**: Exchange-compliant price rounding
- **Slippage Protection**: Market order execution with depth validation

#### Operational Safeguards
- **Daily Trade Limits**: Prevents overtrading and drawdown spirals
- **Connection Monitoring**: WebSocket health checks and reconnection
- **Order State Tracking**: Real-time fill/rejection handling
- **Emergency Exits**: Automatic position closure on system errors

### 4. Execution Architecture

#### Pre-Market Initialization
```
1. Load curated stock universe (high-volume, liquid stocks)
2. Establish WebSocket connection with error handling
3. Subscribe to L2 market depth for entire universe
4. Sync with market open (9:15 AM IST)
5. Initialize risk parameters and trade counters
```

#### Real-time Trading Engine
```
1. SCAN → Continuous market depth analysis across all stocks
2. RANK → Sort by signal strength (dominance percentage)
3. FILTER → Apply pressure thresholds and depth ratios
4. EXECUTE → Place market order with integrated stop-loss
5. MONITOR → Track order status and position management
```

#### Smart Order Management
