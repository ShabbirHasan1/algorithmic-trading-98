# üìà NSE F&O Symbols - Historical Implied Volatility (IV) Fetcher

This Python script fetches:
- **Historical Implied Volatility (IV) data**  
for a list of NSE F&O symbols using the **Sensibull API**.

Additionally, it also retrieves (as supplementary data):
- **Near-expiry futures OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data**  
(because the API provides it together with IV).

The script processes the data and saves a clean CSV file for each symbol, including calculated:
- **IV Rank**  
- **IV Percentile**
