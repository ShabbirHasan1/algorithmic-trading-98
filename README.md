📊 Indian Stock Market OHLCV Dataset (Top 2000 by Market Cap)

This repository contains high-resolution OHLCV datasets for the Top 2000 Indian stocks by market capitalization (as of 2025) across three distinct time periods: 2015–2025, 2020–2025, and 2022–2025. These datasets are meant for academic research, algorithmic trading simulations, backtesting, machine learning modeling, and financial analysis.
