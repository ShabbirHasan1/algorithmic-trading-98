📊 Indian Stock Market OHLCV Dataset (Top 2000 by Market Cap)

This repository contains high-resolution OHLCV datasets for the Top 2000 Indian stocks by market capitalization (as of 2025) across three distinct time periods: 2015–2025, 2020–2025, and 2022–2025. These datasets are meant for academic research, algorithmic trading simulations, backtesting, machine learning modeling, and financial analysis.

📁 Data Structure
Each dataset is split by:

Time Period:

1) 2015–2025
2) 2020–2025
3) 2022–2025

Timeframes:

1) 1-minute
2) 5-minute
3) Daily (EOD)

🔹 Format:

Each file contains OHLCV (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for a specific stock in .csv format.

Columns:
- Date: Datetime of the data point
- Open: Opening price
- High: Highest price during the period
- Low: Lowest price during the period
- Close: Closing price
- Volume: Traded volume during the period

⚠️ Important Notes
1) The Top 2000 companies were selected based on their market capitalization in 2025.
2) Companies that went public after the starting date of a specific time period are excluded from that period’s dataset.
     For example, a stock listed in 2018 will not appear in the 2015–2025 dataset.
3) Data has been processed and organized for efficient access and usage in research environments.

-  Quantitative finance and algorithmic trading
-  Technical analysis studies
